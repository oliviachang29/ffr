        Fossil Free Research is a new campaign to end the toxic influence of fossil fuel money on climate change-related
        research in universities. It is coordinated by international student divestment and climate justice activists with the
        support of a wide range of academics, climate experts, and university members.

        Oil and gas giants develop numerous research partnerships with universities, including elite players like Harvard,
        Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, and Princeton. They have a clear agenda in doing so: making themselves look like legitimate
        partners in advancing climate solutions, and having a role in the production of knowledge around those solutions to
        undermine climate action.
