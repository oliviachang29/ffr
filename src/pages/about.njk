            <p>Fossil Free Research is an organization that supports students and faculty working to expose and dismantle fossil fuel industry influence on higher education, especially concerning climate-related research, in order to protect the integrity of academia and the policy it informs, enable real climate leadership from the academic institutions producing it, revoke the fossil fuel industryâ€™s social license to operate, and upskill the next generation of climate justice leaders.</p>
